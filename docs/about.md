## This site is a prototype coastal data curation service. 

## We are motivated by the recent focus on publishing data with DOIs

One problem with the current data publication landscape is that datasets are stored in many different repositories. Some data have descriptor articles, while some have only metadata. Some data have APIs, some only have `.zip` files. 

Our goal is to develop a service to curate the growing list of published data, point to where it is stored, point to software tools that are useful for processing it, and allow for a forum to discuss the data (both its use, software tooling around that data, and also possible linkages with other datasets.)

## We encourage users to contribute discussions of datasets to this service. 

This can be by writing a markdown file, and contributing it to our github repository. 

Here is the submission file (link to md)

and here is the submission workflow:
- fork the project. 
- fill out a markdown submission
- add your submission to the blog folder
- pull request
- moderator will accept the PR and your submission will be live.

Comments will be accepted anytime on the individual data blog pages. (note that you need a Github account)
