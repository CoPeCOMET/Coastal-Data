We present a minimal example of a collaborative coastal data curation service, located at: https://copecomet.github.io/Coastal-Data/

The site is built with [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

We invite you to contribute in a few ways:
1) contributing data blog entries.
1) discussing/commenting on data blog entries (commenting via [utterances](https://utteranc.es/))
3) giving us feedback (you can do this via github issues in this repository)

You can contribute a data blog entry in one of two ways:
1) Fill out the [template for data blog entries](https://github.com/CoPeCOMET/Coastal-Data/blob/master/DataBlogTemplate.md) and leave the markdwon file (and any other content) in a new issue.
2) Fork the project, fill out the [template for data blog entries](https://github.com/CoPeCOMET/Coastal-Data/blob/master/DataBlogTemplate.md), leave it in the `blog` directory of the repository, and open a pull request.
