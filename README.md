# Coastal Data curation project

We present a minimal example of a collaborative coastal data curation service. 

Here is the site: https://copecomet.github.io/Coastal-Data/

The site is built with [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), and can be foudn int he `gh-pages` branch of this repository.

We invite you to contribute in a few ways:
1) contributing data blog entries
1) discussing/commenting on data blog entries (commenting via [utterances](https://utteranc.es/))
3) giving us feedback (you can do this via github issues in this repository)

Instructions for data blog entries will be added soon.
