**Dataset Name:** NOAA NOS Web Camera Applications Testbed (WebCAT)  
**Dataset DOI/URL:** https://secoora.org/webcat/  
**Dataset descriptor article:** [Dusek et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00353)  
**Dataset API:** No API, but wget request format to access archival imagery can be seen on the WebCAT page above.  
**Code to work with data:** [PyWebCAT](https://github.com/UNCG-DAISY/PyWebCAT), for python and shell CLI.  
**Example uses of dataset:**  
[SurfRCaT](https://github.com/conlin-matt/SurfRCaT) from Matt Conlin for rectifying images.  
[PyWebCAT](https://github.com/UNCG-DAISY/PyWebCAT) has example notebooks.  
Some Labels for video frames that show wave-scarp collision from WebCAT are available [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12765494.v1).  
Previous work by students at UNCW and Dr. Joe Long on runup elevations can be seen in [this repository](https://github.com/Kelseaedwing/SECOORA), from the [data challenge](https://secoora.org/meet-the-2019-data-challenge-winners/)



This dataset could be used for examining several coastal processes, from physical studies (runup, rip currents), to ecological work (dune grass growth) in a variety of settings.
